# Thermodynamics Snookered

This project can be used to simulate a hard sphere gas in a container.

Files
-> Ball.py: 
-- contains the definition of the Ball class, used to represent balls in the 
-- container. 

-> Simulation.py:
-- contains the definition of the Simulation class, used to handle the
-- simulation step-by-step and keep track of the macroscopic properties of the 
-- system. 2 versions of next_collision (next_collision1 and next_collision2)
-- and run (run1 and run2) are included for completeness. Version 2 is faster, 
-- and is called by default from other modules.

-> Testing.py:
-- this is a self-contained testing unit, containing the definition of the Test
-- class, which is a subclass of unittest's TestCase class. Several test cases
-- are defined, and are run automatically when the module is called through the
-- command line or from the IDE. 

-> Experiments.py:
-- this module contains definitions for various experiments which can be 
-- conducted using the simulation. All experiments run with the faster, second
-- version of the next_collision and run methods.

-> SimScript.py:
-- a short example script to demonstrate some uses of the functions defined in
-- the Experiments module.

Usage

Documentation on the parameters and outputs of methods for all classes is 
available using help(). To run experiments and create plots, simply import the
Ball, Simulation classes and Experiments module into a separate script, and
call the relevant function from Experiments.
